Web Development CA1

Create a web application that uses Java Servlets and JDBC along with MySQL to implement
the following functionality:

• A prototype loyalty card application is required for demonstration. You are tasked
with building this web application using Servlets, JDBC and MySQL.

• When a user registers (with their chosen username and password), they are
automatically given 100 loyalty points. Users should register providing a username
and password that is double checked (by the code and not the html page/JS) to ensure
consistent spelling of the password.

• Users can login, and see how many loyalty points they have now. They can choose to
remove/spend points or add points from a receipt. They can keep adding, but they
can’t spend if the balance goes below 0. After adding or spending points the user
should be shown their balance on screen to finish.
